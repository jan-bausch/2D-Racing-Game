# 2D-Racing-Game
## Part of the school paper »Efficient software design of video games«

A top down 2D driving simulator with focus on clean software design.
Featuring an entity-component-system, seperation by concern, car driving simulation, collision system, sounds, user interface and advanced graphics.

Written in [Haxe](haxe.org) with 
 - [OpenFl](openfl.org), a game development framework
 - [Ash](https://www.richardlord.net/ash/), an entity-component-system framework

## Paper
The project was part of a special assignment (»Besondere Lernleistung«) for my A-Levels.

The paper explains development processes and different gameloop designs, compares hierarchically- and component-based modelling and provides a way of simulating car behaviour and collisions.
